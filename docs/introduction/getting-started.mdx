## Installation

Install the following dependencies to your project:

```bash yarn2npm
yarn add gqless
yarn add -D @gqless/cli graphql
```

## Codegen

`gqless` requires information about your schema, which is generated using the **CLI**.

You can start executing:

```bash
npx gqless generate
```

It will create a new configuration file named `gqless.config.cjs` at the root of your project, it will look like this:

> You can also use the `gqless` key in your `package.json`, or use the name `gqless.config.js`

```js
/**
 * @type {import("@gqless/cli").GqlessConfig}
 */
const config = {
  endpoint: '/api/graphql',
  enumsAsStrings: false,
  react: true,
  scalars: { DateTime: 'string' },
  preImport: '',
  introspection: {
    endpoint: 'SPECIFY_ENDPOINT_OR_SCHEMA_FILE_PATH_HERE',
    headers: {},
  },
  destination: './src/gqless/index.ts',
  subscriptions: false,
};

module.exports = config;
```

You can then modify the configuration based on your needs, at least changing `introspection.endpoint`.

> If you leave enabled **"react"** and/or **"subscriptions"**, you will also need to install these libraries:
>
> ```bash yarn2npm
> yarn add @gqless/react @gqless/subscriptions
> ```

Next, you can add a `generate` script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "generate": "gqless generate"
}
```

And then run the script to generate your schema:

```bash yarn2npm
yarn generate
```

The gqless client will be created in your specified `destination`, which by default is `src/gqless/index.ts`, following the structure:

```bash
src/gqless
├── schema.generated.ts # Generated schema, you shouldn't modify it manually
└── index.ts # gqless client is exported from here, you can safely modify it based on your needs
```

## Usage

Ensure that the `queryFetcher` in `src/gqless/index.ts` is correct.

You should then be able to use the client ✨

```ts
import { query } from './gqless';

// for example
query.me.name;
```
