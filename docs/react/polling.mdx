The `usePoll` hook allows you re-fetch data at a set interval.
Polling can be paused/resumed, and is stopped when the component unmounts.

## Usage

Simply call `usePoll` with the data you want polled, and the interval in which it should be:

```jsx
import { graphql, usePoll } from '@gqless/react'

const Component = graphql(() => {
  usePoll(query.hello, 5000) // every 5s

  return <div>{query.hello}</div>
})
```
