## prepass

A common pattern to do while using `gqless` is to just access manually some specified fields, so `gqless` can pick up your requirements faster.
That allows preventing some possible "waterfalling", or simply to make sure to get all the fields requested in the same query,
specially while using conditionals on possible nulls in your GraphQL Schema.

For that use case we offer a very useful function called `prepass`, in which you can give it an object or array, and given some paths, it will traverse them,
with some specific features:

- You can specify the path with different syntaxes `"user.dog.name"`, `["user", "dog", "name"]` or `["user", { field: "pet", variables: { type: "dog" } }, "name"]`
- You **don't** have to specify an array index, since if it finds an array, it will pass-through the **first non-null** value of it
- If you have a field with arguments that you want to access, you can also specify it's value and it will automatically call it's function with that value.

The only **disadvantages** we see are basically:

- If it finds a function, and you don't specify it's variables, it can't check if all variables are actually optional, and it call the function anyways, and that might result in a GraphQL error.
- It doesn't have autocomplete 😔

```ts
import { prepass } from 'gqless';
import { query } from '../gqless';

prepass(
  query.user,
  'dog.name',
  'address.country.name',
  'address.country.location',
  [
    {
      field: 'pet',
      variables: {
        type: 'dog',
      },
    },
    'name',
  ]
  //...
);
```

## selectFields

Given an object or an array of objects, create a new object/array with the specified fields.

### Features and Limitations

- Allows to **select every field** of the proxy with a simple `"*"`.
- But when it encounters a field with arguments, it only returns the function back, since it can't assume your intent,
  even if all arguments are optional.
- Specified keys can be composed via `foo.bar`
- Specify recursive depth _(`1` by default)_
- Bad Type-safety, it just returns the same type as the input

### Examples

```ts
import { selectFields } from 'gqless';
import { query } from '../gqless';

const dataPicked = selectFields(query.user, ['name', 'address.city']);

const dataEverything1Depth = selectFields(query.user, '*');

const dataDeep = selectFields(query.user, '*', 2);
```

## getFields

Given an object, pre-access the specified fields, and returns the object back.

### Features and Limitations

- Good Type-Safety
- Allows keeping the proxies around.
- You can only specify the first level of scalars
- It doesn't do anything for objects inside objects

```ts
import { getFields, query, resolved } from 'gqless';

const data = await resolved(() => {
  return getFields(query.user, 'name', 'email');
});

// Proxy is kept, and you can pass it around safely
// data == query.user
```

### getArrayFields

We also have a helper to work with arrays, and works the same way as `getFields`.

```ts
import { getArrayFields, query, resolved } from 'gqless';

const data = await resolved(() => {
  return getArrayFields(query.allUsers, 'name', 'email');
});

// Proxy Array is kept, and you can pass it around safely
// data == query.allUsers
```

## Type Casters

If you find too annoying having to deal with `undefined` everywhere when
by logic you can be completely sure that in runtime you are not dealing with actual `undefined`s, `gqless` also exports no-op functions
with useful types that removes your `undefined`s.

:::caution
Use with caution, since you might encounter runtime errors if they are used unwisely
:::

:::tip
You can also use the types that are being used for this functions for types-only usage.

### castNotSkeleton

Removes all the `undefined`s in 1 level of your object or array.

This next example is a perfectly safe place to use it, since here `id` and `name` will always be actual values in it's return value, not `undefined`.

```ts
import { castNotSkeleton } from 'gqless';
import { resolved, query } from '../gqless';

const data = await resolved(() => {
  const { id, name } = query.user;

  return castNotSkeleton({
    id,
    name,
  });
});

// query.user = { id: string | undefined; name: string | undefined; }
// data = { id: string; name: string }
```

### castNotSkeletonDeep

Removes all the `undefined`s **recursively** of your object or array.

This next example is a perfectly safe place to use it, since here all the fields returned will always be actual values in it's return value, not `undefined`.

```ts
import { castNotSkeletonDeep } from 'gqless';
import { resolved, query } from '../gqless';

const data = await resolved(() => {
  const { id, name, dogs } = query.user;

  return castNotSkeletonDeep({
    id,
    name,
    dogsNames: dogs.map((dog) => dog.name),
  });
});

// query.user = { id: string | undefined; name: string | undefined; dogs: { name: string | undefined }[] }
// data = { id: string; name: string; dogsNames: string[] }
```
